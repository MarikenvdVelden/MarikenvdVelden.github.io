						<h3>Welcome!</h3>
						<p style="text-align:justify">I am an Assistant Professor of Political Communication in the Department of Communication Science
							at the <a href="https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-social-sciences/departments/communication-science" target="_blank">  <i>Vrije Universiteit</i> Amsterdam</a>.
							I received my PhD in Political Science from the <a href="https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/faculties/faculty-of-social-sciences/departments/political-science-and-public-administration" target="_blank"> <i>Vrije Universiteit</i> Amsterdam</a>.
							Before joining the Department of Communication Science, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.ipz.uzh.ch/de.html" target="_blank"> Institute of Political Science
							at the University of Zurich</a>, and visiting researcher of the Departments of Political Science at <a href="https://politicalscience.unc.edu/" target="_blank"> the University of North Carolina</a>,
							Chapel Hill and <a href="https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank"> the University of Oxford</a>. </p>
							<p style="text-align:justify">My research interest comprise the areas of political communication, political behavior, and computational social science.
							I am motivated by key societal challenges that face democracies today, such as the crisis of representative
							democracy and increasing political fragmentation. Specifically, I apply advanced computational approaches to study the
							communication and rhetoric of politicians, and how this affects political decision making and its electoral consequences
							in multi-party systems. </p>
							<p style="text-align:justify">In my current work, I examine the legitimacy of political decision-making.
							In one project, I study the electoral ramifications of (un)compromising politicians.
							This research project is funded through a <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/nwo-talent-programme/projects-veni/2019" target="_blank">Innovation Grant (VENI)</a> by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).
							In another project, I look at the perceived legitimacy of goverment communication, which is funded through a <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/researchprogrammes/dutch-research-agenda-nwa/innovation-and-networks-nwa/small-projects-nwa-routes" target="_blank">National Science Agenda Grant </a> by NWO.
							Moreover, as part of the <a href="https://opted.eu/" target="_blank">OPTED H2020 consortium </a> funded by the European Research Council, I work on methods to compare textual data
							in multilangual settings.

						<h4> Epistemic Overconfidence in Algorithmic News Selection

						<b> Abstract:</b> The process of news consumption has undergone great changes over the past decade: Information is now available in an ever-increasing amount from a plethora of sources. Recent work suggests that most people would favor algorithmic solutions over human editors. This stands in contrast to public and scholarly debate about the pitfalls of algorithmic news selection - i.e. so-called “filter bubbles”. This study therefore investigates the reasons and motivations which might lead people to prefer algorithmic gatekeepers over human ones. We expect that people have more algorithmic appreciation when consuming news to pass time, entertain oneself or out of escapism than when using news to keep up-to-date with politics (H1). Secondly, we hypothesize the extent to which people are confident in their own cognitive abilities moderates that relationship: When people are overconfident in their own capabilities to estimate the relevance of information, they are more likely to have higher levels of algorithmic appreciation, due to the third person effect (H2). For testing those <a href="https://osf.io/2tqwy" target="_blank"> two pre-registered hypothesis </a>, we conducted an online survey with a sample of 268 U.S. participants, and replicated our study using a sample of 384 Dutch participants. The results show that the first hypothesis cannot be supported by our data. However, a positive interaction between overconfidence and algorithmic appreciation in case the gratification of news usage is surveillance (i.e. gaining information about the world, society, and politics) was found in both samples. Thereby, our study contributes to our understanding of the underlying reasons people have for choosing different forms of gatekeeping when selecting news.
